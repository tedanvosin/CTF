We were able to listen in on our oponnents for a while, and managed to capture the ciphertexts and plaintexts of their communication, but were eventually kicked out. I'll send you a dump of what we managed to get so far, but long story short, there are pairs of encrypted and decrypted communications. We have reason to believe they're not following otp-imal security practices, and the most valualbe communication should be happening any second now. I'll link the file below. Good luck.
